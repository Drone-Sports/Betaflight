# Betaflight Configurator, Firmware, and Settings

> **Warning:**  Do not attempt to upgrade Betaflight versions without following [these instructions](https://www.dronesoccer.us/blog/tips-tricks-2/upgrading-firmware-to-4-3-20)! A complete guide with illustrations is available in the Education Shared Google Drive for partner organizations.

Betaflight is a free open-source flight control software. It has two distinct parts.

**FIRMWARE** is the code within the droneâ€™s flight controller itself. Do not change this if your drone is working. 

**CONFIGURATOR** is the desktop app that provides a graphical interface to modify the firmware. This is safe to upgrade and 10.8 is recommended for all users. 

Where to download the Betaflight Configurator 10.8:

 - [Windows](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/download/10.8.0/betaflight-configurator_10.8.0_win64-installer.exe) 
 - [MacOS](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases/download/10.8.0/betaflight-configurator_10.8.0_macOS.dmg)

Betaflight Firmware version 4.3 REQUIRES the latest Configurator Version 10.8 to function.
> **Warning:** If you are utilizing Chromebooks, DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR FIRMWARE. 
> The outdated Google Plugin of Betaflight Configurator is 10.4 and you must use Firmware 4.2.
> There is a way to revert new 4.3 drones back to 4.2.

Backups of the factory settings are available at in the [Settings Folder](https://github.com/Drone-Sports/Betaflight/tree/main/Settings). You can save these settings as a .txt to your computer (using save link as, or copy the code into Notepad, TextEdit, or another editor and save as a .txt file).
